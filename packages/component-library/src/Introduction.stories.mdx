## Installation

In the host project:

`npm i @nuwe/component-library`

You will also need the following peer dependencies installed in the host project:

```
"react"
"react-dom"
"@mui/material"
```

### Deploying with Vercel

## Directives for building new components (in progress)

- Avoid exporting styled-components directly unless it's really necessary.
- Never export styled component css snippets.
- Annotate the component props with relevant info to help understand how to use them.
- Export theme as a variable with a list of constants.
- Write unit tests for complex components. Visually check everything else in Storybook.
- Add stories for components as they would appear in the app. This should go in a `[component].stories.tsx` file.
- Add documentation for the component to explain its usage. This should go in a `[component].stories.mdx` file.
- Use storybook [parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction#using-parameters) to set up common background colours/layouts where a component could be used.
- Use storybook [controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls) to allow for users to test the props variant where possible.

## Usage

```
import { NavBar } from "@nuwe/component-library";
```

### Installation

### Storybook

To get going with Storybook:

`npm run storybook`

This should create a local server (usually on `localhost:6006`) with the interface. The environment
makes use of hot reloading, so there is no need to refresh your browser as you build.

## Publishing

Follow the instructions outlined [here](../../README.md#publishing-changes-to-npm)
